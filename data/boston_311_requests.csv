Therefore, we ask that any New Tree Request for a new pit and tree comes from the actual abutting property owner, and then we can then inspect that location for tree planting. If you know the property owner of this address, you can ask them to submit a New Tree Request with their contact information and we will be able to inspect the location and discuss any questions that may arise. New Tree Requests can be made via the 311 app, by calling 311, or by contacting the Urban Forestry Division by sending an email to trees@boston.gov or calling 617-635-8733. The best way to get information about Boston's street trees is by going to boston.gov/trees and reading about how to properly request a new street tree, to submit tree maintenance requests, and learn how to care for young street trees.
